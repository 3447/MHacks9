## MHacks9 Lookup

** General Information **

This project is a Google Chrome extension that looks up detailed information on a selected word or phrase. This information is displayed 
in a sidebar that overlays on the right side of the webpage. The extension's primary information is pulled from Wolfram Alpha, with 
content loaded from Wikipedia, Merriam-Webster Dictionary, and a link is provided to Dictionary.com when relevant. The type of the phrase 
searched determines what information is fetched from these sources and displayed on the sidebar. This extension uses APIs from the 
following companies: Wolfram Alpha, Wikipedia, and Merriam-Webster. This extension was designed to provide a quick set of information 
regarding a phrase to clarify any doubts the reader may have had, so that an unfamiliar word or idea does not inhibit the reader's ability 
to understand the entire article they were reading. MHacks9 Lookup was inspired by the Google Dictionary extension and the Wikipedia 
mobile application.
